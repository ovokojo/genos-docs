## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork locally: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git`
3. Create a new branch for your feature or bug fix: `git checkout -b feature-or-fix-name`

## Development Environment

1. Ensure you have Python 3.7+ installed.
2. We recommend using a virtual environment:
   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
3. Install the project dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # For development dependencies
   ```

## Coding Standards

We follow PEP 8 guidelines and use additional tools to maintain code quality:

1. Use [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) for code formatting:
   ```
   black .
   ```
2. Use [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) to sort imports:
   ```
   isort .
   ```
3. Use [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/) for linting:
   ```
   flake8 .
   ```
4. Use [mypy](http://mypy-lang.org/) for static type checking:
   ```
   mypy .
   ```

## Testing

1. We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) for testing. Write tests for all new features and bug fixes.
2. Run the test suite before submitting your changes:
   ```
   pytest
   ```
3. Aim for high test coverage. We use [coverage.py](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/) to measure it:
   ```
   coverage run -m pytest
   coverage report
   ```

## Documentation

1. Use [Google-style docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods.
2. Update the README.md file if you've added new features or changed existing functionality.
3. If applicable, update or add to the project's documentation.

## Submitting Changes

1. Commit your changes: `git commit -am 'Add some feature'`
2. Push to your fork: `git push origin feature-or-fix-name`
3. Submit a pull request through GitHub.

## Code Review Process

1. A project maintainer will review your pull request.
2. They may suggest changes or improvements.
3. Make any requested changes and push them to your fork.
4. Once approved, a maintainer will merge your pull request.

## Community Guidelines

1. Be respectful and considerate in all interactions.
2. Follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
3. If you find a security vulnerability, please report it privately to the maintainers.

Thank you for contributing to [Project Name]! Your efforts help make this project better for everyone.
