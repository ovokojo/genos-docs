## Style Guide
To ensure consistency and readability of the project, please follow the [Google Python Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide.html).

### File & Directory Names

**âœ… Use Lowercase with Hyphens or Underscores:**
Use lowercase letters and separate words with hyphens or underscores for directory names. 
**Example:** `src/components`, `utils/helpers`, `test_cases`.

ðŸš« **Avoid Camel Case:**
Camel case (e.g., `myDirectory`) is less common for directory names and can be harder to read quickly.

### File Naming Conventions
**Script Files:** Use descriptive names for scripts.
    -   **Example:** `deploy.sh`, `build.js`, `data_migration.py`.

**Test Files:** Include `test` in the file name to clearly indicate that the file contains tests.
    -   **Example:** `user_service_test.js`, `test_data_parser.py`.

**Configuration Files:** Use consistent extensions and descriptive names
	    - **Example:** `config.json`, `app-config.yaml`, `settings.py`.


### Git Branch Names
Branch names should describe the purpose of the branch clearly. This helps other contributors understand the branch's purpose at a glance. 

Use lowercase letters and separate words with hyphens. Also use prefixes to indicate the type of work being done in the branch. Common prefixes include feature, bugfix, hotfix, & release.

Include versioning where significant updates are required or there are parallel development needs.

**Format:** `prefix/<feature-or-issue-name>-v<version>`
**Examples:** `feature/file-upload-v1.0.0`, `bugfix/database-error`, `hotfix/database-connection`
