# Genos Docs

‚ö°Ô∏è Quickly deploy an intelligent search engine for your private documentation.

We are developing open-source infrastructure to simplify the creation of chat interfaces for proprietary data. 

Our vision is a future where people and organizations can effortlessly upload their data, configure privacy settings, select language models, and swiftly deploy chat interfaces tailored to their needs.


##  Application Overview

Genos Docs is a Python web app built using robust open source frameworks that enable rapid prototyping. This approach to building an intelligent search engine prioritizes speed and simplicity.

### Core Technologies
- [Python](https://www.python.org/): The primary programming language used for both frontend and backend.
-  [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/): A faster way to build & share data apps.
- [LlamaIndex](https://www.llamaindex.ai/): A data framework for LLM-based applications to ingest, structure, and access private or domain-specific data.
- [Chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/): An AI-native vector database.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Python 3.12 or later installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Shell Scripts

- Use `./run.sh` in the root folder to run the Streamlit app
